Description: Anyone with pets knows how much work it is to raise them and would love for someone else to take care of their pets needs. The goal of Taskimal is to provide a platform where people can both make tasks that they are willing to do for their set price and book appointments for tasks they want for their pets. Tasks are categorized by exercise, such as walking, training, such as basic commands, boarding, to house animals, and misc, which includes anything else not included in the first three categories.

Technologies used: Used flask/react to make this website.

Stretch goals: Would love to make a way to have a payment system implemented because this is a concept that I was thinking about making in the future.
